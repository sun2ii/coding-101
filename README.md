# Who Am I ?

My name is [Ben Basuni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benbasuni/) and I've been a programmer for 10+ years. I've worked at Datadog where I created a chrome extension for the team (150+ employees installed it before I left) theere on keyboard shortcuts, I'm a huge vim advocate. Before I was a coder, I 3.5x my output production (300 returns to my 1000 returns / mth) at my job at the Franchise Tax Board for the government by using macros. I graduated as a philosophy major, so I think very deeply about problems and how they translate into value.

I currently work at XOPS but am also starting my own venture at https://www.enzi.ai.  
We're always looking for talent and hiring ! So feel free to connect with me.

# Why did I create this ?

I created this because my sister had a question about a telegram bot that she created. She asked me what an API is, and after giving her the basic answer of it and realize the complexities that someone without a coding background has, I started to think about what are the simplest ideas to accelerate your way to understanding code at a deeper level.

It's not leetcode. It's just basic simple concepts and projects to create on your own. I would say the most value you would get from these videos is after you spend time working on your own projects and struggling on your own, then you can come back here after a mentally tired brain, and you can hopefully see the true gems that i am giving out for free.

I am confident that if you watch my videos, work hard on projects, you will guarantee become more senior than a lot of people out there in the working world. My videos will not make you a better leetcoder, but it will make you a better coder in general.

If you disagree, contact me and I'll schedule some 1:1 time to walk you through it.
