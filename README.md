# Coding 101

# Who Am I ?
My name is [Ben Basuni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benbasuni/) and I've been a programmer for 10+ years. I've worked at Datadog where I created a chrome extension for the team over there on keyboard shortcuts, I'm a vim advocate. Before I was a coder, I 10x my output production at my job at the Franchise Tax Board for the government by using macros. I graduated as a philosophy major, so I think very deeply about problems and how they translate into their business use case.

# Why did I create this ? 
I created this because my sister had a question about a telegram bot that she wanted. She asked me what an API is, and after giving her the basic answer of it, I started to see that I wanted to develop my own understanding of what this is about.
